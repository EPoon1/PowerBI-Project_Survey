In this project I exclusively used PowerBI to transform the data(removed useless columns, standardized the data, and even created columns where I think would be useful based on the data) using Power Query.
Next, I created the inital "cards" to show at a quick glance how many survey takers there were and what's the average age of them.
Then, I created visualizations based on what I think other people would want to see if they want to get into becoming a data analyst as well, showing if they have a favorite programming language, average salary, how difficult it was, and happiness gauges.
I also implemented a "drill down" feature if someone would want to look at more data from these visualizations.
